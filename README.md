# Blink-Cylon
My first IoT project.

This will make an led light blink every one second on Raspberry PI 4. This is for the purposes of learning.

npm install to install gulp, candyman, cylon and cylon-raspi

Note, cylon-raspi will only install on the Raspberry PI device. It will not install on your local machine.
